*9 Degrees of Freedom-Razor IMU (SEN-10736)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736)

The 9DOF Razor IMU incorporates three sensors - an ITG-3200 (MEMS triple-axis gyro), ADXL345 (triple-axis accelerometer), and HMC5883L (triple-axis magnetometer) - 
to give you nine degrees of inertial measurement. 
The outputs of all sensors are processed by an on-board ATmega328 and output over a serial interface. This enables the 9DOF Razor to be used as a very powerful control mechanism for UAVs, 
autonomous vehicles and image stabilization systems.
